## Project Background Analysis

Due to the growing acceptance of remote work and the gig economy, there are more freelancers in the world. However, finding their ideal project can be challenging for freelancers. Similar to this, clients frequently struggle to find a trustworthy and qualified individual for their work. Due to the lack of a trustworthy platform, there is a mismatch between the two parties as a result. 
To solve this mismatch problem, we developed TARF (a global marketplace for freelancing services), a platform for freelancers and clients to effectively connect. TARF offers a user-friendly interface for efficient communication, debating project details, and negotiating payment arrangements. The software's administrator is always on hand to monitor user behavior and guarantee strict security.

## Root cause of the problem

The root cause of the problem is the lack of a centralized platform that connects both freelancers and clients. There are several current freelance websites, but because of their complex user interfaces, users frequently find them difficult to navigate. As a result, using it is quite difficult for clients and independent contractors. Additionally, some online platforms offer a low level of trust, which is unsatisfactory for productive collaboration.

## Project Solution and Feasibility Analysis

The main goal of TARF is to offer a user-friendly and effective platform that makes it easier for freelancers to find clients and clients to hire them. It provides advantages such as shorter search times for the freelancers to find jobs, clients to find reliable workers, safe negotiation of payment between two parties, access to a large talent pool and a user-friendly interface. By achieving these objectives, TARF aims to create a platform that benefits both freelancers and clients. There are several software programs already on the market that are designed to make the process of connecting clients and freelancers more efficiently. Some of the most popular ones include Fiverr, Upwork, Freelancer.com, Guru, Toptal etc.
The TARF project was created with a view to improving the efficiency and usability of the freelancing process for both clients and freelancers. Even though there are other platforms in the market which provide similar features, TARF is slightly different in few ways. It has a user-friendly interface, which has been designed to be simple and intuitive. It has user-friendly navigation features that make it easier for clients and freelancers to connect and find suitable work, saving time and effort. Furthermore, TARF also places high priority on its userâ€™s security, protecting users from scam activities and ensuring a safe and secure experience. This freelancing software also matches clients with the most suitable freelancers based on their preferences and requirements. 

Overall, TARF offers a unique and innovative approach to freelancing by combining features such as user-friendly design, automation, enhanced security, and personalized matching. TARF is unique in its features and is intended to improve the experience for clients and freelancers, despite certain parallels with other projects on the market.
